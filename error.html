    <h1>Apologies for Not Inviting You to Our Wedding</h1>
    <p>Dear [Recipient's Name],</p>
    
    <p>We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to extend our sincerest apologies for not including you in our wedding guest list. We understand that receiving this message may be disappointing, and we genuinely regret any inconvenience or hurt feelings it may have caused.</p>
    
    <p>Planning a wedding can be a challenging process, and unfortunately, we had to make some tough decisions regarding the number of guests we could accommodate. As much as we would have loved to invite everyone, our venue's capacity and budget constraints made it necessary to narrow down the list.</p>
    
    <p>Please know that our decision was not a reflection of our relationship with you. We hold you in high regard and value the connection we share. The limited guest list was a result of various factors beyond our control.</p>
    
    <p>We want to emphasize that we would have loved to celebrate our special day with you. However, we hope you understand the difficult choices we had to make. We still cherish our friendship/relationship and look forward to sharing many more joyous moments together in the future.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your understanding and for being a part of our lives. We genuinely appreciate your support and friendship/relationship. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.</p>
    
    <p>Warmest regards,</p>
